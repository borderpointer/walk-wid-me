# Walk Wid Me

### Built With:

### Gems Used:

### Synopsis

Walk Wid Me is a simple app that allows users to go on a virtual walk with a dog. Upon landing, users are shown a random first person dog walking video from the app's database to watch and if they don't like it, they can watch another random first person dog walking video.


### Motivation

I wanted to build a simple Rails app that utilizes Angular.js.
