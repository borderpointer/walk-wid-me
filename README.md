# Walk Wid Me

### Built With:

### Synopsis

Walk Wid Me is a simple app that allows users to go on a virtual walk with a dog, and save that walk if they wish to. Upon landing, the user is given a random first person dog walking video from the app's database to watch and if they don't like it, they can watch another random first person dog walking video.


### Motivation

I wanted to build a simple Rails app that utilizes Angular.js.
